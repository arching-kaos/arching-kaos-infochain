If you want to hack this you are more than welcome to do so. Instead of
only trying to break though, you can contribute your solution to the
problem.

You can use this piece of software to maintain your own asset/token.

It's for sure possible for someone to copy this program and use it to
rollout another infochain on another asset.

Things that would matter of research based on my opinion are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Render all transactions and decide how to render each BLOCK's action
  This would be nice to have and use in general, it's creative subject.
\item
  Download latest transactions (like 5-100) and find the rest of the
  chain through BLOCK's previous IPFS CID This would interesting on
  figuring out if and how each BLOCK inherits the previous CIDs
  correctly. Assuming that anyone could forge the previous' value it
  would be really valuable to verify in comparison with the whole of
  transaction history which is always the safest route.
\item
  Create subchains Since our genesis block is an empty file, it would be
  interesting to start chains with other values as well. For example, a
  file containing 0 or 1 or other integers, simple words and/or phrazes.
\end{enumerate}

Happy hacking
