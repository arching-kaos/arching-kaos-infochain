Apart from reading HACKING file, there is also this one in order to say
a couple of stuff.

I would really appreciate any comments, issues, pull requests or
whatever in order to make this better.

Since you read this on github
(https://github.com/kaotisk-hund/arching-kaos-infochain) there are tools
to help each other. If you feel doing so, you are more than welcomed to
do so.

I worked mostly on how to split and stuck back the messages ( README,
Whitepaper ), so the ``core'' is developed, though this is done in
parts.

Read ROADMAP file to get an idea onto which directions the project is
mostly to move towards. Note, that ROADMAP is also incomplete.

You can discuss in Keybase where you can find arching\_kaos team.
Channels there are \#general, \#roadmap, \#infochain. There is also IRC
client ready to use at https://irc.arching-kaos.net
